# 4-Channel-Mains-Current-Sensor
A 4-Channel mains sensor with an option for either a Wemos D1 Mini or an ESP-12 WiFi module

Included are two Arduino sketch files, one a basic test and one for MQTT. In both cases the firmware reports the mV AC across the 22 ohm burden resistor. These voltages are also present on the 6 pin test header.
